# DNAgnosis- AI Application for Genome Modeling and Design Across All Domains of Life With Evo 2

This project is a full-stack web application that predicts the pathogenicity of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in human DNA using the Evo2 large language model (LLM) and classifies how likely specific mutations in DNA are to cause diseases (variant effect prediction)
